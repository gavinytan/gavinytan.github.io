## Other Projects
[Stack Interpreter](https://github.com/gavinytan)
-Built a custom stack interpreter using OCaml as the final project of a Concepts of Programming Languages course. Interpreter is designed to first take in a string and then parse the string for commands, execute the commands, and then return a list of outputs and an error code.
