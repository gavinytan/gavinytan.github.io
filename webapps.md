## Web App Projects
[Boston Children's Hospital ALS Message Banking](https://github.com/BU-Spark/se-bch-als-msg-banking)
-Developed a web app for Boston Children’s Hospital that automatically processes audio files of ALS patients’ voices into snippets of edited audio that can be used to generate synthetic voices. Significantly decreased the amount of hours required to edit audio files into workable snippets, making synthetic voices more accessible to those losing their speech capabilities to ALS. Won Boston University Spark Demo Day’s Audience Choice Award out of nearly 40 student projects.
