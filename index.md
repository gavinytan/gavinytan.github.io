# About Me
I am currently pursuing a BA in Computer Science with a minor in Visual Arts at Boston University. I became interested in CS due to my interest in video games. My most familiar languages are C/C++, C#, Python, OCaml, and Java. In my freetime, I enjoy playing for my school's Overwatch team, drawing, and practicing martial arts.

## Projects
[Shaded 3D Object Renderer](https://github.com/gavinytan)
-Built a triangle mesh generator with support for torus, cylinder, sphere, ellipsoid, and cube primitives. Used GLSL to implement a Phong reflection model to shade the 3D primitives.

[3D Aquarium Simulation](https://github.com/gavinytan)
-Created a 3D aquarium simulation with animated predator, prey, and food models. Implemented chase/evasion, collision, and rotation behavior of the predator and prey creatures.

[Boston Children's Hospital ALS Message Banking](https://github.com/BU-Spark/se-bch-als-msg-banking)
-Developed a web app for Boston Children’s Hospital that automatically processes audio files of ALS patients’ voices into snippets of edited audio that can be used to generate synthetic voices. Significantly decreased the amount of hours required to edit audio files into workable snippets, making synthetic voices more accessible to those losing their speech capabilities to ALS. Won Boston University Spark Demo Day’s Audience Choice Award out of nearly 40 student projects.

[Online Photo Sharing Application](https://github.com/gavintanbu/CS460Project1)
-Created a SQL database system and web interface for a photo sharing app. Implemented in Python the ability to add users and friends, create albums, upload captions, tag photos, and comment.

[Movie Info Web App](https://github.com/gavinytan/MovieInfoWebApp)
-Worked with a team of students to plan and build a web app with decoupled architecture. The app utilizes a decoupled architecture with Node.js and React. OAuth authentication and a database are used to store user login info. The app's functionality includes the ability to call several different APIs to find and suggest current movies.

[Stack Interpreter](https://github.com/gavinytan)
-Built a custom stack interpreter using OCaml as the final project of a Concepts of Programming Languages course. Interpreter is designed to first take in a string and then parse the string for commands, execute the commands, and then return a list of outputs and an error code.

[Minecraft Plugins](https://github.com/gavin-y-tan/MinecraftPlugins)
-Custom plugins (made with the Bukkit/Spigot package), for the game Minecraft, that each implement different custom game modes.

[Multiplayer FPS Prototype](https://github.com/gavin-y-tan/UnityGameTestFiles)
-Game prototype (made with the Unity Engine), with the basic mechanics of a multiplayer first-person shooter. Current mechanics include: shooting with raycasts, player movement, camera movement, objectives, UI, and LAN networking (using the Unity networking API, Mirror).
