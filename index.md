# About Me
I am currently pursuing a BA in Computer Science at Boston University. I became interested in CS due to my interest in video games. My most familiar languages are C, C#, Python, OCaml, and Java. In my freetime I enjoy playing for my school's Overwatch team and practicing martial arts.

## Projects
Stack Interpreter
-Built a custom stack interpreter using OCaml as the final project of a Concepts of Programming Languages course. Interpreter was designed to first take in a string and then parse the string for commands, execute the commands, and then return a list of outputs and an error code


[Minecraft Plugins](https://github.com/gavin-y-tan/MinecraftPlugins)
-Custom plugins (made with the Bukkit/Spigot package), for the game Minecraft, that each implement different custom game modes.

[Multiplayer FPS Prototype](https://github.com/gavin-y-tan/UnityGameTestFiles)
-Game prototype (made with the Unity Engine), with the basic mechanics of a multiplayer first-person shooter. Current mechanics including: shooting with raycasts, player movement, camera movement, objectives, UI, and LAN networking (using the Unity networking API, Mirror).
