# About Me
I am currently pursuing a BA in Computer Science with a minor in Visual Arts at Boston University. I became interested in CS due to my interest in video games. My most familiar languages are C/C++, C#, Python, OCaml, and Java. In my freetime, I enjoy playing for my school's Overwatch team, drawing, and practicing martial arts.

## Projects
3D Aquarium Simulation
-Created a 3D aquarium simulation with animated predator, prey, and food models. Implemented chase/evasion, collision, and rotation behavior of the predator and prey creatures

[Movie Info Web App](https://github.com/gavinytan/MovieInfoWebApp)
-Worked with a team of students to plan and build a web app with decoupled architecture. The app utilizes a decoupled architecture with Node.js and React. OAuth authentication and a database are used to store user login info. The app's functionality includes the ability to call several different APIs to find and suggest current movies.

Stack Interpreter
-Built a custom stack interpreter using OCaml as the final project of a Concepts of Programming Languages course. Interpreter is designed to first take in a string and then parse the string for commands, execute the commands, and then return a list of outputs and an error code.
